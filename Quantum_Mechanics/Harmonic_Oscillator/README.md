# Harmonic Oscillator & Discretization Approach

A Harmonic Oscillator is a fundamental quantum system where a particle experiences a restoring force proportional to its displacement, leading to discrete quantized energy levels. The quantum version of the oscillator features a parabolic potential, with wavefunctions extending across the entire domain.

To solve SchrÃ¶dingerâ€™s equation numerically, we discretize space into a grid and approximate the second derivative using finite differences. This transforms the differential equation into a matrix eigenvalue problem, where solving for eigenvalues gives the allowed energy levels and eigenvectors represent the wavefunctions.

This approach provides a practical way to visualize quantum states and their probability distributions.
