# Quantum Well & Discretization Approach

A Quantum Well is a system where a particle is confined within a potential, allowing only specific quantized energy levels. In the Infinite Potential Well, the particle is trapped between two rigid walls, and its wavefunction must vanish at the boundaries.

To solve SchrÃ¶dingerâ€™s equation numerically, we discretize space into a grid and approximate the second derivative using finite differences. This transforms the differential equation into a matrix eigenvalue problem, where solving for eigenvalues gives the allowed energy levels and eigenvectors represent the wavefunctions.

This approach provides a practical way to visualize quantum states and their probability distributions.
