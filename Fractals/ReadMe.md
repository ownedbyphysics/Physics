# Madelbrot Set
This project generates and visualizes the Mandelbrot set, a famous mathematical fractal defined by iterative equations in the complex plane. 
The Mandelbrot set is known for its intricate, self-similar patterns and infinite detail when zoomed in.


# Features
Customizable Resolution: Define the canvas size for better clarity or performance.
Adjustable Iterations: Control the maximum number of iterations to fine-tune the fractal detail.
Color Mapping: Use Matplotlib's colormaps (viridis, magma, etc.) to create stunning visualizations.
Zoom and Explore: The code can be easily modified to zoom into specific regions of the set
