# Madelbrot Set
This project contains a Python notebook that simulates the thermal response of a Nickel surface under a Gaussian laser pulse, as well as a simulation involving a Nickel surface with a Gold substrate.

This project generates and visualizes the Mandelbrot set, a famous mathematical fractal defined by iterative equations in the complex plane. 
The Mandelbrot set is known for its intricate, self-similar patterns and infinite detail when zoomed in.
