Quantum Well & Discretization Approach
A Quantum Well is a system where a particle is confined within a potential, allowing only specific quantized energy levels. In the Infinite Potential Well, the particle is trapped between two rigid walls, and its wavefunction must vanish at the boundaries.

To solve Schrödinger’s equation numerically, we discretize space into a grid and approximate the second derivative using finite differences. This transforms the differential equation into a matrix eigenvalue problem, where solving for eigenvalues gives the allowed energy levels and eigenvectors represent the wavefunctions.

This approach provides a practical way to visualize quantum states and their probability distributions.
