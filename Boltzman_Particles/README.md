🎲 Maxwell–Boltzmann Velocity Distribution Simulation
This project simulates the velocity distribution of gas particles in thermal equilibrium and compares the results with the theoretical Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution. It provides a visual and statistical demonstration of the stochastic behavior of particles in an ideal gas.

📌 What it does
Simulates 3D velocities of gas molecules (e.g., nitrogen) using random sampling from a Gaussian distribution.

Computes the magnitude of particle speeds from velocity components.

Plots a histogram of the simulated particle speeds.

Overlays the theoretical Maxwell–Boltzmann probability density function (PDF) using the exact analytical expression.

Highlights the effects of temperature on particle speed distribution.
