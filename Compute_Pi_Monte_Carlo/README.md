# Monte Carlo Ï€ Approximation

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Monte Carlo method to approximate the value of Ï€. The program generates random points within a square, calculates how many fall within a unit circle, and uses this ratio to estimate Ï€.

ðŸ“· Visualization: The program shows two dynamic plots:
A scatter plot of randomly generated points (red for inside the circle, blue for outside).
A line plot that shows the running approximation of Ï€.
Monte Carlo Simulation: The approximation improves as more points are generated, demonstrating how the Monte Carlo method works.
