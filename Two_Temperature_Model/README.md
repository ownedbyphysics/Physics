# Two Temperature Model (TTM) Simulation
This project contains a Python notebook that simulates the thermal response of a Nickel surface under a Gaussian laser pulse, as well as a simulation involving a Nickel surface with a Gold substrate.


# Overview of the Two Temperature Model (TTM)
The Two Temperature Model (TTM) is a commonly used approach for simulating the thermal response of metals when subjected to ultrafast laser pulses. In metals, energy deposited by the laser primarily heats up the free electrons, which then transfer heat to the lattice (the atomic structure of the metal). The TTM separates these two systems—electrons and lattice—and treats their temperatures independently, which is crucial for understanding laser-matter interactions on short timescales.


# Plots Overview:

1. Nickel Surface (Electron vs. Lattice Temperature):
   
This plot displays the evolution of electron and lattice temperatures over time for a Nickel surface irradiated by a Gaussian pulse.
The plot illustrates how the electron temperature rises rapidly due to the energy input from the laser pulse and how the lattice temperature follows after a slight delay as energy is transferred from the electrons to the lattice.

2. Nickel with Gold Substrate (All Four Temperatures):
   
This plot explores the thermal response of a more complex system, where a Nickel surface is in contact with a Gold substrate.
The plot shows the temperature evolution of both the electron and lattice systems for Nickel and Gold. It provides insight into the heat transfer dynamics between the two materials and their respective electron and lattice systems.
